-printf "%f\n"awk '{print}' file_name.txt
!!!prints out everyting on the text file !!!awk '/latte {print}' menu.txt
!!! shows everything involving the string/pattern "latte" !!!Awk '{print $1,$4}' file_name.txt
!!! shows numbers with either 1 or 4 !!!tail /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print $NF}'
!!! the NF is a representing "number of fields" !!!awk 'NR==3, NR==7 {print NR,1$,3$,4$}' file_name.txt
!!! the NR specifies which lines to read out !!!sort file_name.txt
!!! sorts alpha numerically, symbols first, then numbers, then letters !!!sort -o new_file.txt old_file.txt
!!! the -o appends to a new file, -r reverses the way its appended !!!sort -u file_name.txt
!!! removes EXACT duplicates !!!sort -n file_name.txt
!!! sorts based off numbers negatives going first !!!sed 's/neword/oldword/g' file_name.txt
!!! replaces all of "oldwords" with "newords" the "s" at the begining marks it as substitution and the "g" makes it global- (affects entire doc) !!!sed 's/neword/oldword/2' file_name.txt
!!! replaces at the second occurrence of "oldwords" !!!sed '5 s/neword/oldword/' file_name.txt
!!! replaces at the first occurence at the 5th line !!!uniq -c file_name.txt
!!! returns the amount of times a string was repeated (case sensitive and only compares line above and below) !!!
!!! in order to effecitvley use this command use sort and then pipe it into uniq !!!uniq -d file_name.txt
!!! shows what strings are duplicates !!!uniq -D file_name.txt
!!! shows ALL strings that are duplicate !!!!= is for strings and numbersif [[ 41 -ne 50 ]]; then
    echo "41 is NOT 50"
else
    echo "41 IS 50"
fi!!! "-eq" does not work with numbers !!!A=$(tail /etc/passwd)
!!! puts the last 10 lines of etc/passwd into variable A !!!
